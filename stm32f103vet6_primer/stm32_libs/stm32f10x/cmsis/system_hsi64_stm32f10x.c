  * @brief   CMSIS Cortex-M3 Device Peripheral Access Layer System Source File.
  * 
  *          This file contains the system clock configuration for STM32F103 devices
  *          and is customized for use with stm32f103_nucleo Kit. 
  *          The STM32F103 is configured to run at 72 MHz, following the three  
  *          configuration below:
  *            - PLL_SOURCE_HSI   (default)     : HSI (~8MHz) used to clock the PLL, and
  *                                               the PLL is used as system clock source,
  *                                               64 MHz is maximum frequency on PLL HSI mode.
  *            - PLL_SOURCE_HSE                 : HSE (8MHz) used to clock the PLL, and 
  *                                               the PLL is used as system clock source.
  *            - PLL_SOURCE_HSE_BYPASS          : HSE bypassed with an external clock 
  *                                              (8MHz, coming from ST-Link) used to clock
  *                                              the PLL, and the PLL is used as system
  *                                              clock source.  
  *              
  * 1.  This file provides two functions and one global variable to be called from 
  *     user application:
  *      - SystemInit(): Setups the system clock (System clock source, PLL Multiplier
  *                      factors, AHB/APBx prescalers and Flash settings). 
  *                      This function is called at startup just after reset and 
  *                      before branch to main program. This call is made inside
  *                      the "startup_stm32f10x_xx.s" file.
  *
  *      - SystemCoreClock variable: Contains the core clock (HCLK), it can be used
  *                                  by the user application to setup the SysTick 
  *                                  timer or configure other parameters.
  *                                     
  *      - SystemCoreClockUpdate(): Updates the variable SystemCoreClock and must
  *                                 be called whenever the core clock is changed
  *                                 during program execution.
  *
  * 2. After each device reset the HSI (8 MHz) is used as system clock source.
  *    Then SystemInit() function is called, in "startup_stm32f10x_xx.s" file, to
  *    configure the system clock before to branch to main program.
  *
  * 3. If the system clock source selected by user fails to startup, the SystemInit()
  *    function will do nothing and HSI still used as system clock source. User can 
  *    add some code to deal with this issue inside the SetSysClock() function.
  *
  * 4. The default value of HSE crystal is set to 8 MHz. 
  *    When HSE is used as system clock source, directly or through PLL, and you
  *    are using different crystal you have to adapt the HSE value to your own
  *    configuration.
  *

  *           frequency in the chip. It is calculated based on the predefined 
  *           constant and the selected clock source:
  *             
  *           - If SYSCLK source is HSI, SystemCoreClock will contain the HSI_VALUE(*)

  *           - If SYSCLK source is PLL, SystemCoreClock will contain the HSE_VALUE(**) 
  *             or HSI_VALUE(*) multiplied by the PLL factors.
  *         
  *         (*) HSI_VALUE is a constant defined in stm32f1xx.h file (default value
  *             8 MHz) but the real value may vary depending on the variations
  *             in voltage and temperature.   
  *    
  *         (**) HSE_VALUE is a constant defined in stm32f1xx.h file (default value
  *              8 MHz or 25 MHz, depending on the product used), user has to ensure
  *              that HSE_VALUE is same as the real frequency of the crystal used.
  *              Otherwise, this function may have wrong result.
  *                
  *         - The result of this function could be not correct when using fractional
  *           value for HSE crystal.
